# KyberShards

A modular Python library providing implementations of machine learning components, data structures, and analysis tools for data science

## Introduction

KyberShards is a Python library designed to provide modular, efficient implementations of essential tools for data science and machine learning workflows. Whether you're exploring data, building models, or analyzing results, KyberShards aims to provide robust components that work seamlessly together while maintaining flexibility for customization.

The library is designed with both clarity and performance in mind, making it suitable for educational settings as well as production environments. By breaking down complex algorithms into understandable components (or "shards"), we promote transparency and enable users to combine these pieces in creative ways.

> **⚠️ Alpha Version Notice**: KyberShards is currently in alpha stage. The API and functionality are subject to change as we refine the library based on user feedback and ongoing development. We recommend using version pinning if incorporating KyberShards into production systems.

## Installation

```bash
pip install kybershards
```

## Documentation

## Alpha Status Notice
KyberShards is currently in alpha development. This means:

- APIs may change without maintaining backward compatibility
- Features may be added, modified, or removed without advance notice
- Documentation may lag behind implementations
- Some components may be less tested than others

We welcome feedback and contributions to help improve the library during this development phase.
