# KyberShards

A modular Python library providing implementations of machine learning components, data structures, and analysis tools for data science

## Introduction

KyberShards is a Python library designed to provide modular, efficient implementations of essential tools for data science and machine learning workflows. Whether you're exploring data, building models, or analyzing results, KyberShards aims to provide robust components that work seamlessly together while maintaining flexibility for customization.

The library is designed with both clarity and performance in mind, making it suitable for educational settings as well as production environments. By breaking down complex algorithms into understandable components (or "shards"), we promote transparency and enable users to combine these pieces in creative ways.

## Installation

```bash
pip install kybershards
```
